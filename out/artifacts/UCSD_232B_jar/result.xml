<TITLE>ACT IV</TITLE>

<SCENE>
<TITLE>SCENE I.  A house in Rome.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>ANTONY, OCTAVIUS, and LEPIDUS, seated at a table</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These many, then, shall die; their names are prick'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do consent--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prick him down, Antony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon condition Publius shall not live,</LINE>
<LINE>Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.</LINE>
<LINE>But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;</LINE>
<LINE>Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine</LINE>
<LINE>How to cut off some charge in legacies.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LEPIDUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, shall I find you here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or here, or at the Capitol.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit LEPIDUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is a slight unmeritable man,</LINE>
<LINE>Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,</LINE>
<LINE>The three-fold world divided, he should stand</LINE>
<LINE>One of the three to share it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So you thought him;</LINE>
<LINE>And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,</LINE>
<LINE>In our black sentence and proscription.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Octavius, I have seen more days than you:</LINE>
<LINE>And though we lay these honours on this man,</LINE>
<LINE>To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,</LINE>
<LINE>He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,</LINE>
<LINE>To groan and sweat under the business,</LINE>
<LINE>Either led or driven, as we point the way;</LINE>
<LINE>And having brought our treasure where we will,</LINE>
<LINE>Then take we down his load, and turn him off,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,</LINE>
<LINE>And graze in commons.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may do your will;</LINE>
<LINE>But he's a tried and valiant soldier.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So is my horse, Octavius; and for that</LINE>
<LINE>I do appoint him store of provender:</LINE>
<LINE>It is a creature that I teach to fight,</LINE>
<LINE>To wind, to stop, to run directly on,</LINE>
<LINE>His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.</LINE>
<LINE>And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;</LINE>
<LINE>He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;</LINE>
<LINE>A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds</LINE>
<LINE>On abjects, orts and imitations,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, out of use and staled by other men,</LINE>
<LINE>Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,</LINE>
<LINE>But as a property. And now, Octavius,</LINE>
<LINE>Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius</LINE>
<LINE>Are levying powers: we must straight make head:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore let our alliance be combined,</LINE>
<LINE>Our best friends made, our means stretch'd</LINE>
<LINE>And let us presently go sit in council,</LINE>
<LINE>How covert matters may be best disclosed,</LINE>
<LINE>And open perils surest answered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let us do so: for we are at the stake,</LINE>
<LINE>And bay'd about with many enemies;</LINE>
<LINE>And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,</LINE>
<LINE>Millions of mischiefs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SCENE>
<TITLE>SCENE II.  Camp near Sardis. Before BRUTUS's tent.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Drum. Enter BRUTUS, LUCILIUS, LUCIUS, and
Soldiers; TITINIUS and PINDARUS meeting them</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand, ho!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCILIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give the word, ho! and stand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCILIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is at hand; and Pindarus is come</LINE>
<LINE>To do you salutation from his master.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,</LINE>
<LINE>In his own change, or by ill officers,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath given me some worthy cause to wish</LINE>
<LINE>Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,</LINE>
<LINE>I shall be satisfied.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PINDARUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not doubt</LINE>
<LINE>But that my noble master will appear</LINE>
<LINE>Such as he is, full of regard and honour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;</LINE>
<LINE>How he received you, let me be resolved.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCILIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With courtesy and with respect enough;</LINE>
<LINE>But not with such familiar instances,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor with such free and friendly conference,</LINE>
<LINE>As he hath used of old.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast described</LINE>
<LINE>A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,</LINE>
<LINE>When love begins to sicken and decay,</LINE>
<LINE>It useth an enforced ceremony.</LINE>
<LINE>There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;</LINE>
<LINE>But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;</LINE>
<LINE>But when they should endure the bloody spur,</LINE>
<LINE>They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,</LINE>
<LINE>Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCILIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd;</LINE>
<LINE>The greater part, the horse in general,</LINE>
<LINE>Are come with Cassius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hark! he is arrived.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Low march within</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>March gently on to meet him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter CASSIUS and his powers</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand, ho!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand, ho! Speak the word along.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Soldier</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Soldier</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Soldier</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?</LINE>
<LINE>And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;</LINE>
<LINE>And when you do them--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cassius, be content.</LINE>
<LINE>Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.</LINE>
<LINE>Before the eyes of both our armies here,</LINE>
<LINE>Which should perceive nothing but love from us,</LINE>
<LINE>Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;</LINE>
<LINE>Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,</LINE>
<LINE>And I will give you audience.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pindarus,</LINE>
<LINE>Bid our commanders lead their charges off</LINE>
<LINE>A little from this ground.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man</LINE>
<LINE>Come to our tent till we have done our conference.</LINE>
<LINE>Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE>
<TITLE>SCENE III.  Brutus's tent.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:</LINE>
<LINE>You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella</LINE>
<LINE>For taking bribes here of the Sardians;</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein my letters, praying on his side,</LINE>
<LINE>Because I knew the man, were slighted off.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You wronged yourself to write in such a case.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In such a time as this it is not meet</LINE>
<LINE>That every nice offence should bear his comment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself</LINE>
<LINE>Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;</LINE>
<LINE>To sell and mart your offices for gold</LINE>
<LINE>To undeservers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I an itching palm!</LINE>
<LINE>You know that you are Brutus that speak this,</LINE>
<LINE>Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The name of Cassius honours this corruption,</LINE>
<LINE>And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Chastisement!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Remember March, the ides of March remember:</LINE>
<LINE>Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?</LINE>
<LINE>What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,</LINE>
<LINE>And not for justice? What, shall one of us</LINE>
<LINE>That struck the foremost man of all this world</LINE>
<LINE>But for supporting robbers, shall we now</LINE>
<LINE>Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,</LINE>
<LINE>And sell the mighty space of our large honours</LINE>
<LINE>For so much trash as may be grasped thus?</LINE>
<LINE>I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,</LINE>
<LINE>Than such a Roman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Brutus, bay not me;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,</LINE>
<LINE>To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,</LINE>
<LINE>Older in practise, abler than yourself</LINE>
<LINE>To make conditions.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go to; you are not, Cassius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say you are not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;</LINE>
<LINE>Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away, slight man!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is't possible?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear me, for I will speak.</LINE>
<LINE>Must I give way and room to your rash choler?</LINE>
<LINE>Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;</LINE>
<LINE>Go show your slaves how choleric you are,</LINE>
<LINE>And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?</LINE>
<LINE>Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch</LINE>
<LINE>Under your testy humour? By the gods</LINE>
<LINE>You shall digest the venom of your spleen,</LINE>
<LINE>Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,</LINE>
<LINE>When you are waspish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it come to this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You say you are a better soldier:</LINE>
<LINE>Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,</LINE>
<LINE>And it shall please me well: for mine own part,</LINE>
<LINE>I shall be glad to learn of noble men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;</LINE>
<LINE>I said, an elder soldier, not a better:</LINE>
<LINE>Did I say 'better'?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If you did, I care not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I durst not!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, durst not tempt him!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For your life you durst not!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do not presume too much upon my love;</LINE>
<LINE>I may do that I shall be sorry for.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have done that you should be sorry for.</LINE>
<LINE>There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,</LINE>
<LINE>For I am arm'd so strong in honesty</LINE>
<LINE>That they pass by me as the idle wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I respect not. I did send to you</LINE>
<LINE>For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:</LINE>
<LINE>For I can raise no money by vile means:</LINE>
<LINE>By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring</LINE>
<LINE>From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash</LINE>
<LINE>By any indirection: I did send</LINE>
<LINE>To you for gold to pay my legions,</LINE>
<LINE>Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?</LINE>
<LINE>Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?</LINE>
<LINE>When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,</LINE>
<LINE>To lock such rascal counters from his friends,</LINE>
<LINE>Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;</LINE>
<LINE>Dash him to pieces!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I denied you not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You did.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did not: he was but a fool that brought</LINE>
<LINE>My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:</LINE>
<LINE>A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,</LINE>
<LINE>But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not, till you practise them on me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You love me not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not like your faults.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A friendly eye could never see such faults.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A flatterer's would not, though they do appear</LINE>
<LINE>As huge as high Olympus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,</LINE>
<LINE>Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,</LINE>
<LINE>For Cassius is aweary of the world;</LINE>
<LINE>Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;</LINE>
<LINE>Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,</LINE>
<LINE>Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,</LINE>
<LINE>To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep</LINE>
<LINE>My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,</LINE>
<LINE>And here my naked breast; within, a heart</LINE>
<LINE>Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:</LINE>
<LINE>If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;</LINE>
<LINE>I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:</LINE>
<LINE>Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,</LINE>
<LINE>When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better</LINE>
<LINE>Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sheathe your dagger:</LINE>
<LINE>Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;</LINE>
<LINE>Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.</LINE>
<LINE>O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb</LINE>
<LINE>That carries anger as the flint bears fire;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,</LINE>
<LINE>And straight is cold again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath Cassius lived</LINE>
<LINE>To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,</LINE>
<LINE>When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And my heart too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Brutus!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Have not you love enough to bear with me,</LINE>
<LINE>When that rash humour which my mother gave me</LINE>
<LINE>Makes me forgetful?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,</LINE>
<LINE>When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,</LINE>
<LINE>He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Poet</SPEAKER>
<LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Within</STAGEDIR>  Let me go in to see the generals;</LINE>
<LINE>There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet</LINE>
<LINE>They be alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCILIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Within</STAGEDIR>  You shall not come to them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Poet</SPEAKER>
<LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Within</STAGEDIR>  Nothing but death shall stay me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter Poet, followed by LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, and LUCIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now! what's the matter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Poet</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For shame, you generals! what do you mean?</LINE>
<LINE>Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;</LINE>
<LINE>For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll know his humour, when he knows his time:</LINE>
<LINE>What should the wars do with these jigging fools?</LINE>
<LINE>Companion, hence!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away, away, be gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit Poet</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders</LINE>
<LINE>Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you</LINE>
<LINE>Immediately to us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt LUCILIUS and TITINIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lucius, a bowl of wine!</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit LUCIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I did not think you could have been so angry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of your philosophy you make no use,</LINE>
<LINE>If you give place to accidental evils.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ha! Portia!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?</LINE>
<LINE>O insupportable and touching loss!</LINE>
<LINE>Upon what sickness?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Impatient of my absence,</LINE>
<LINE>And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony</LINE>
<LINE>Have made themselves so strong:--for with her death</LINE>
<LINE>That tidings came;--with this she fell distract,</LINE>
<LINE>And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And died so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O ye immortal gods!</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Re-enter LUCIUS, with wine and taper</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.</LINE>
<LINE>In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.</LINE>
<LINE>Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come in, Titinius!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit LUCIUS</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter TITINIUS, with MESSALA</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Welcome, good Messala.</LINE>
<LINE>Now sit we close about this taper here,</LINE>
<LINE>And call in question our necessities.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Portia, art thou gone?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more, I pray you.</LINE>
<LINE>Messala, I have here received letters,</LINE>
<LINE>That young Octavius and Mark Antony</LINE>
<LINE>Come down upon us with a mighty power,</LINE>
<LINE>Bending their expedition toward Philippi.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With what addition?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That by proscription and bills of outlawry,</LINE>
<LINE>Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,</LINE>
<LINE>Have put to death an hundred senators.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Therein our letters do not well agree;</LINE>
<LINE>Mine speak of seventy senators that died</LINE>
<LINE>By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cicero one!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cicero is dead,</LINE>
<LINE>And by that order of proscription.</LINE>
<LINE>Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, Messala.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing, Messala.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That, methinks, is strange.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:</LINE>
<LINE>For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:</LINE>
<LINE>With meditating that she must die once,</LINE>
<LINE>I have the patience to endure it now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even so great men great losses should endure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have as much of this in art as you,</LINE>
<LINE>But yet my nature could not bear it so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, to our work alive. What do you think</LINE>
<LINE>Of marching to Philippi presently?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not think it good.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your reason?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This it is:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis better that the enemy seek us:</LINE>
<LINE>So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,</LINE>
<LINE>Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,</LINE>
<LINE>Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.</LINE>
<LINE>The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground</LINE>
<LINE>Do stand but in a forced affection;</LINE>
<LINE>For they have grudged us contribution:</LINE>
<LINE>The enemy, marching along by them,</LINE>
<LINE>By them shall make a fuller number up,</LINE>
<LINE>Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;</LINE>
<LINE>From which advantage shall we cut him off,</LINE>
<LINE>If at Philippi we do face him there,</LINE>
<LINE>These people at our back.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear me, good brother.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Under your pardon. You must note beside,</LINE>
<LINE>That we have tried the utmost of our friends,</LINE>
<LINE>Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:</LINE>
<LINE>The enemy increaseth every day;</LINE>
<LINE>We, at the height, are ready to decline.</LINE>
<LINE>There is a tide in the affairs of men,</LINE>
<LINE>Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;</LINE>
<LINE>Omitted, all the voyage of their life</LINE>
<LINE>Is bound in shallows and in miseries.</LINE>
<LINE>On such a full sea are we now afloat;</LINE>
<LINE>And we must take the current when it serves,</LINE>
<LINE>Or lose our ventures.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, with your will, go on;</LINE>
<LINE>We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The deep of night is crept upon our talk,</LINE>
<LINE>And nature must obey necessity;</LINE>
<LINE>Which we will niggard with a little rest.</LINE>
<LINE>There is no more to say?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more. Good night:</LINE>
<LINE>Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.</LINE>

<LINE>Good night, and good repose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O my dear brother!</LINE>
<LINE>This was an ill beginning of the night:</LINE>
<LINE>Never come such division 'tween our souls!</LINE>
<LINE>Let it not, Brutus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Every thing is well.</LINE>

<LINE>Farewell, every one.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but BRUTUS</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter LUCIUS, with the gown</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here in the tent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, thou speak'st drowsily?</LINE>
<LINE>Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'er-watch'd.</LINE>
<LINE>Call Claudius and some other of my men:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;</LINE>
<LINE>It may be I shall raise you by and by</LINE>
<LINE>On business to my brother Cassius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VARRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;</LINE>
<LINE>It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.</LINE>
<LINE>Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;</LINE>
<LINE>I put it in the pocket of my gown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>VARRO and CLAUDIUS lie down</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I was sure your lordship did not give it me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.</LINE>
<LINE>Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,</LINE>
<LINE>And touch thy instrument a strain or two?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my lord, an't please you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It does, my boy:</LINE>
<LINE>I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is my duty, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I should not urge thy duty past thy might;</LINE>
<LINE>I know young bloods look for a time of rest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have slept, my lord, already.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;</LINE>
<LINE>I will not hold thee long: if I do live,</LINE>
<LINE>I will be good to thee.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Music, and a song</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,</LINE>
<LINE>Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,</LINE>
<LINE>That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;</LINE>
<LINE>I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:</LINE>
<LINE>If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.</LINE>
<LINE>Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down</LINE>
<LINE>Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter the Ghost of CAESAR</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?</LINE>
<LINE>I think it is the weakness of mine eyes</LINE>
<LINE>That shapes this monstrous apparition.</LINE>
<LINE>It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,</LINE>
<LINE>That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?</LINE>
<LINE>Speak to me what thou art.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GHOST</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy evil spirit, Brutus.</LINE>

<LINE>Why comest thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GHOST</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well; then I shall see thee again?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GHOST</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, at Philippi.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Ghost</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:</LINE>
<LINE>Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The strings, my lord, are false.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He thinks he still is at his instrument.</LINE>
<LINE>Lucius, awake!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I do not know that I did cry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!</LINE>

<LINE>My lord?</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VARRO</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did we, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay: saw you any thing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VARRO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, my lord, I saw nothing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLAUDIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor I, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;</LINE>
<LINE>Bid him set on his powers betimes before,</LINE>
<LINE>And we will follow.</LINE>

<TITLE>ACT V</TITLE>

<SCENE>
<TITLE>SCENE I.  The plains of Philippi.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:</LINE>
<LINE>You said the enemy would not come down,</LINE>
<LINE>But keep the hills and upper regions;</LINE>
<LINE>It proves not so: their battles are at hand;</LINE>
<LINE>They mean to warn us at Philippi here,</LINE>
<LINE>Answering before we do demand of them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know</LINE>
<LINE>Wherefore they do it: they could be content</LINE>
<LINE>To visit other places; and come down</LINE>
<LINE>With fearful bravery, thinking by this face</LINE>
<LINE>To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;</LINE>
<LINE>But 'tis not so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter a Messenger</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Prepare you, generals:</LINE>
<LINE>The enemy comes on in gallant show;</LINE>
<LINE>Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,</LINE>
<LINE>And something to be done immediately.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Octavius, lead your battle softly on,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the left hand of the even field.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why do you cross me in this exigent?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not cross you; but I will do so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>March</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Drum. Enter BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and their Army;
LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, MESSALA, and others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They stand, and would have parley.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.</LINE>
<LINE>Make forth; the generals would have some words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stir not until the signal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not that we love words better, as you do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:</LINE>
<LINE>Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>The posture of your blows are yet unknown;</LINE>
<LINE>But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,</LINE>
<LINE>And leave them honeyless.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not stingless too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, yes, and soundless too;</LINE>
<LINE>For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,</LINE>
<LINE>And very wisely threat before you sting.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers</LINE>
<LINE>Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:</LINE>
<LINE>You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,</LINE>
<LINE>And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind</LINE>
<LINE>Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:</LINE>
<LINE>This tongue had not offended so to-day,</LINE>
<LINE>If Cassius might have ruled.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,</LINE>
<LINE>The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;</LINE>
<LINE>I draw a sword against conspirators;</LINE>
<LINE>When think you that the sword goes up again?</LINE>
<LINE>Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds</LINE>
<LINE>Be well avenged; or till another Caesar</LINE>
<LINE>Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless thou bring'st them with thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So I hope;</LINE>
<LINE>I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,</LINE>
<LINE>Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,</LINE>
<LINE>Join'd with a masker and a reveller!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Old Cassius still!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, Antony, away!</LINE>
<LINE>Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:</LINE>
<LINE>If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;</LINE>
<LINE>If not, when you have stomachs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim bark!</LINE>
<LINE>The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ho, Lucilius! hark, a word with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Messala!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Standing forth</STAGEDIR>  What says my general?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Messala,</LINE>
<LINE>This is my birth-day; as this very day</LINE>
<LINE>Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:</LINE>
<LINE>Be thou my witness that against my will,</LINE>
<LINE>As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set</LINE>
<LINE>Upon one battle all our liberties.</LINE>
<LINE>You know that I held Epicurus strong</LINE>
<LINE>And his opinion: now I change my mind,</LINE>
<LINE>And partly credit things that do presage.</LINE>
<LINE>Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign</LINE>
<LINE>Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;</LINE>
<LINE>Who to Philippi here consorted us:</LINE>
<LINE>This morning are they fled away and gone;</LINE>
<LINE>And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,</LINE>
<LINE>Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,</LINE>
<LINE>As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem</LINE>
<LINE>A canopy most fatal, under which</LINE>
<LINE>Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe not so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I but believe it partly;</LINE>
<LINE>For I am fresh of spirit and resolved</LINE>
<LINE>To meet all perils very constantly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even so, Lucilius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, most noble Brutus,</LINE>
<LINE>The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,</LINE>
<LINE>Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!</LINE>
<LINE>But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,</LINE>
<LINE>Let's reason with the worst that may befall.</LINE>
<LINE>If we do lose this battle, then is this</LINE>
<LINE>The very last time we shall speak together:</LINE>
<LINE>What are you then determined to do?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even by the rule of that philosophy</LINE>
<LINE>By which I did blame Cato for the death</LINE>
<LINE>Which he did give himself, I know not how,</LINE>
<LINE>But I do find it cowardly and vile,</LINE>
<LINE>For fear of what might fall, so to prevent</LINE>
<LINE>The time of life: arming myself with patience</LINE>
<LINE>To stay the providence of some high powers</LINE>
<LINE>That govern us below.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, if we lose this battle,</LINE>
<LINE>You are contented to be led in triumph</LINE>
<LINE>Thorough the streets of Rome?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,</LINE>
<LINE>That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;</LINE>
<LINE>He bears too great a mind. But this same day</LINE>
<LINE>Must end that work the ides of March begun;</LINE>
<LINE>And whether we shall meet again I know not.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore our everlasting farewell take:</LINE>
<LINE>For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!</LINE>
<LINE>If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;</LINE>
<LINE>If not, why then, this parting was well made.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!</LINE>
<LINE>If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;</LINE>
<LINE>If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know</LINE>
<LINE>The end of this day's business ere it come!</LINE>
<LINE>But it sufficeth that the day will end,</LINE>
<LINE>And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!</LINE>

<TITLE>SCENE III.  Another part of the field.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Alarums. Enter CASSIUS and TITINIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!</LINE>
<LINE>Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:</LINE>
<LINE>This ensign here of mine was turning back;</LINE>
<LINE>I slew the coward, and did take it from him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TITINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, having some advantage on Octavius,</LINE>
<LINE>Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter PINDARUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PINDARUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;</LINE>
<LINE>Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord</LINE>
<LINE>Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius;</LINE>
<LINE>Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TITINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Titinius, if thou lovest me,</LINE>
<LINE>Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him,</LINE>
<LINE>Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops,</LINE>
<LINE>And here again; that I may rest assured</LINE>
<LINE>Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TITINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will be here again, even with a thought.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;</LINE>
<LINE>My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,</LINE>
<LINE>And tell me what thou notest about the field.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>PINDARUS ascends the hill</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>This day I breathed first: time is come round,</LINE>
<LINE>And where I did begin, there shall I end;</LINE>
<LINE>My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PINDARUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Above</STAGEDIR>  O my lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PINDARUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Above</STAGEDIR>  Titinius is enclosed round about</LINE>
<LINE>With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.</LINE>
<LINE>He's ta'en.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Shout</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And, hark! they shout for joy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CASSIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come down, behold no more.</LINE>
<LINE>O, coward that I am, to live so long,</LINE>
<LINE>To see my best friend ta'en before my face!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>PINDARUS descends</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Come hither, sirrah:</LINE>
<LINE>In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;</LINE>
<LINE>And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,</LINE>
<LINE>That whatsoever I did bid thee do,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;</LINE>
<LINE>Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,</LINE>
<LINE>That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.</LINE>
<LINE>Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;</LINE>
<LINE>And, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,</LINE>
<LINE>Guide thou the sword.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>PINDARUS stabs him</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Caesar, thou art revenged,</LINE>
<LINE>Even with the sword that kill'd thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Dies</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PINDARUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, I am free; yet would not so have been,</LINE>
<LINE>Durst I have done my will. O Cassius,</LINE>
<LINE>Far from this country Pindarus shall run,</LINE>
<LINE>Where never Roman shall take note of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter TITINIUS with MESSALA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is but change, Titinius; for Octavius</LINE>
<LINE>Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,</LINE>
<LINE>As Cassius' legions are by Antony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TITINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These tidings will well comfort Cassius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where did you leave him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TITINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All disconsolate,</LINE>
<LINE>With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is not that he that lies upon the ground?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TITINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He lies not like the living. O my heart!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is not that he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TITINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, this was he, Messala,</LINE>
<LINE>But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,</LINE>
<LINE>As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,</LINE>
<LINE>So in his red blood Cassius' day is set;</LINE>
<LINE>The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;</LINE>
<LINE>Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!</LINE>
<LINE>Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.</LINE>
<LINE>O hateful error, melancholy's child,</LINE>
<LINE>Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men</LINE>
<LINE>The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou never comest unto a happy birth,</LINE>
<LINE>But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TITINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet</LINE>
<LINE>The noble Brutus, thrusting this report</LINE>
<LINE>Into his ears; I may say, thrusting it;</LINE>
<LINE>For piercing steel and darts envenomed</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus</LINE>
<LINE>As tidings of this sight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TITINIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hie you, Messala,</LINE>
<LINE>And I will seek for Pindarus the while.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit MESSALA</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?</LINE>
<LINE>Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they</LINE>
<LINE>Put on my brows this wreath of victory,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!</LINE>
<LINE>But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I</LINE>
<LINE>Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,</LINE>
<LINE>And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.</LINE>
<LINE>By your leave, gods:--this is a Roman's part</LINE>
<LINE>Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Kills himself</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Alarum. Re-enter MESSALA, with BRUTUS, CATO,
STRATO, VOLUMNIUS, and LUCILIUS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Titinius' face is upward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is slain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!</LINE>
<LINE>Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords</LINE>
<LINE>In our own proper entrails.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Low alarums</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Brave Titinius!</LINE>
<LINE>Look, whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are yet two Romans living such as these?</LINE>
<LINE>The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!</LINE>
<LINE>It is impossible that ever Rome</LINE>
<LINE>Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears</LINE>
<LINE>To this dead man than you shall see me pay.</LINE>
<LINE>I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:</LINE>
<LINE>His funerals shall not be in our camp,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;</LINE>
<LINE>And come, young Cato; let us to the field.</LINE>
<LINE>Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night</LINE>
<LINE>We shall try fortune in a second fight.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?</LINE>
<LINE>I will proclaim my name about the field:</LINE>
<LINE>I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!</LINE>
<LINE>A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend;</LINE>
<LINE>I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;</LINE>
<LINE>Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCILIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O young and noble Cato, art thou down?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius;</LINE>
<LINE>And mayst be honour'd, being Cato's son.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Soldier</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yield, or thou diest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCILIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Only I yield to die:</LINE>
<LINE>There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Offering money</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Soldier</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We must not. A noble prisoner!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Soldier</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.</LINE>

<LINE>Where is he?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCILIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:</LINE>
<LINE>I dare assure thee that no enemy</LINE>
<LINE>Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus:</LINE>
<LINE>The gods defend him from so great a shame!</LINE>
<LINE>When you do find him, or alive or dead,</LINE>
<LINE>He will be found like Brutus, like himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,</LINE>
<LINE>A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;</LINE>
<LINE>Give him all kindness: I had rather have</LINE>
<LINE>Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,</LINE>
<LINE>And see whether Brutus be alive or dead;</LINE>
<LINE>And bring us word unto Octavius' tent</LINE>
<LINE>How every thing is chanced.</LINE>

<LINE>Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLITUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Statilius show'd the torch-light, but, my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>He came not back: he is or ta'en or slain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word;</LINE>
<LINE>It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Whispers</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLITUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace then! no words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLITUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll rather kill myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Hark thee, Dardanius.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Shall I do such a deed?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLITUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Dardanius!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DARDANIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Clitus!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLITUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What ill request did Brutus make to thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DARDANIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLITUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now is that noble vessel full of grief,</LINE>
<LINE>That it runs over even at his eyes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What says my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, this, Volumnius:</LINE>
<LINE>The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me</LINE>
<LINE>Two several times by night; at Sardis once,</LINE>
<LINE>And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:</LINE>
<LINE>I know my hour is come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;</LINE>
<LINE>Our enemies have beat us to the pit:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Low alarums</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,</LINE>
<LINE>Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou know'st that we two went to school together:</LINE>
<LINE>Even for that our love of old, I prithee,</LINE>
<LINE>Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VOLUMNIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's not an office for a friend, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Alarum still</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLITUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.</LINE>
<LINE>Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,</LINE>
<LINE>My heart doth joy that yet in all my life</LINE>
<LINE>I found no man but he was true to me.</LINE>
<LINE>I shall have glory by this losing day</LINE>
<LINE>More than Octavius and Mark Antony</LINE>
<LINE>By this vile conquest shall attain unto.</LINE>
<LINE>So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue</LINE>
<LINE>Hath almost ended his life's history:</LINE>
<LINE>Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,</LINE>
<LINE>That have but labour'd to attain this hour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Alarum. Cry within, 'Fly, fly, fly!'</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLITUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fly, my lord, fly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hence! I will follow.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt CLITUS, DARDANIUS, and VOLUMNIUS</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou art a fellow of a good respect;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:</LINE>
<LINE>Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,</LINE>
<LINE>While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STRATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRUTUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, good Strato.</LINE>

<LINE>Caesar, now be still:</LINE>
<LINE>I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.</LINE>

LUCILIUS, and the army</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What man is that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STRATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:</LINE>
<LINE>The conquerors can but make a fire of him;</LINE>
<LINE>For Brutus only overcame himself,</LINE>
<LINE>And no man else hath honour by his death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCILIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.</LINE>
<LINE>Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STRATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do so, good Messala.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How died my master, Strato?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STRATO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I held the sword, and he did run on it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MESSALA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Octavius, then take him to follow thee,</LINE>
<LINE>That did the latest service to my master.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ANTONY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This was the noblest Roman of them all:</LINE>
<LINE>All the conspirators save only he</LINE>
<LINE>Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;</LINE>
<LINE>He only, in a general honest thought</LINE>
<LINE>And common good to all, made one of them.</LINE>
<LINE>His life was gentle, and the elements</LINE>
<LINE>So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up</LINE>
<LINE>And say to all the world 'This was a man!'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>According to his virtue let us use him,</LINE>
<LINE>With all respect and rites of burial.</LINE>
<LINE>Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,</LINE>
<LINE>Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.</LINE>
<LINE>So call the field to rest; and let's away,</LINE>
<LINE>To part the glories of this happy day.</LINE>
